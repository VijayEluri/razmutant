		there are many types of asset finders. One basic is provided in the sdk, 
		which can find files based on extension.
		
		the properties for each finder are in a sub-element "finderProps". 
		"extension" is the only exception since it is so common...	
		
		to define your own screwy asset type, put together a finder and a player. 
		that's it
