		cloud are the hosts: the list of hosts in your home network name: name
		of this agent/device - SHOULD be the hostname, unless you run more
		than 1 on a box hostname: is the actual name of the box, case
		sensitive. It is optional - defaults to $name type:
		oneof(laptop,desktop,handheld,router,proxy) - use the proper type, i
		won't look for movies on a router :) media: for each host, map all
		local media folders when maping media, make sure the remote mapping
		does not include the two \\ also, remote paths MUST use / not \,
		f___ing windows!!!
		
		NOTE that if you give a device a port number, I assume there's an agent running there...

	<!--
		Networks used only to list the current one by subnet mask and add the
		proxy if running remote. The mutant will figure out on which network
		the current copy works and use the proxy for the active network. Most
		people's home networks are in the "192.168.1" ip. I have a screwy
		setup with both .1 and .2 so I use "192.168." as the prefix... do as
		you must.
